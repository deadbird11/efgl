# efgl
## About
Currently, this is just a C++ abstraction of the OpenGL API (I plan to expand to other rendering APIs at some point, such as Vulkan). It will be useful for me to have this around for various projects I might want to do in the future.
### Long-term Goals
I want to collect a lot of graphical effects and techniques here in the `efgl/Sandbox/src/examples` folder, along with animation techniques and other stuff having to do with real-time rendering. Once I have those, I want to revisit my [JumboEngine project](https://github.com/deadbird11/JumboEngine) and begin building a rendering engine there.
### Progress So Far

## Getting Started
### Requirements
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), although I plan to make this cross-platform eventually    
### Installation
Open a command prompt in the directory where want to clone the repo. Enter `git clone --recursive https://github.com/deadbird11/efgl.git`, then `cd efgl`. Type the command `cd setup/`, followed by `./setup.exe`. In the `efgl/` directory, there should now be a file named `efgl.sln`.   
### Building `efgl` as a static library
First, open `efgl/efgl.sln` in Visual Studio. Click on the `efgl` __project__ (not solution) in the solution explorer on the left.

Press <kbd>âŒ˜B</kbd> to build the selected project. Now, in the main `eflg/` directory, your .lib file should be in a directory named something like `efgl/bin/efgl/Debug-windows-x86_64/`.  
### Using the `efgl` Sandbox
First, open `efgl/efgl.sln` in Visual Studio. Then, you can simply use the Sandbox project as you would any other project as it comes with the linking and include directories already set up. Add your source files in `/efgl/Sandbox/src`, which will come with a simple `main.cpp` already there.      
### Using `efgl` in another project
For this, you will need to follow the steps in the section titled "Building `efgl` as a static library." Once you have the .lib file, add it as a dependency to your project. For the headers, I recommend adding `efgl/efgl/src`, `efgl/vendor/GLFW/include`, `efgl/vendor/Glad/include`, and `efgl/vendor/stb` to your list of include directories. In those folders, you will also find `glfw3.lib`, which you should link your project against, and `glad.c`, which you should include in your project as source code. 
### Running examples
Simply exclude `main.cpp` from your project, and include the folder of the example that you wish to run. Inside the example, there is a `main` function defined that will handle the rest. If you wish to save what you are doing as an example, make a new folder in the `Sandbox/src/examples` folder with all of your shaders and resources that you used. Remember to update the paths to reflect this!
### Profiling
To do profiling with this library, define the `PROFILING` macro. This will write to a `[something]results.json` file in the `efgl/Sandbox` directory. Simply drag & drop this file into [`about:tracing`](chrome://tracing) to see the profiling results. To profile a function, type `PROFILE_FUNCTION()` at thbeginning, and wrap the function call between a call to `Instrumentor::Get().BeginSession[session name]` and `Instrumentor::Get().EndSession()`.
## Acknowledgements
* Thank you to [The Cherno](https://github.com/TheCherno) for his awesome Youtube series that got me into OpenGL, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2). He also came up with the `premake5.lua` script except for the minor changes I've made.
* This project currently relies on [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), which is an open-source library for OpenGL.    
* This project also relies on [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), which is a OpenGL Loader-Generator.
* I am using [ASSIMP](https://www.assimp.org/) as my model loading library.
