# renderer-api
This is just going to be a convinient tool for me to have. It is an abstraction of the OpenGL API (I might start using other ones at some point, Vulkan looks awesome) and it comes with a playground project that works out of the box. My eventual plan for this is to be able to drop this library into any project and be able to use graphics. Maybe one day I'll have a graphics library like [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw)?
