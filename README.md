# efgl
## About
Currently, this is just a C++ abstraction of the OpenGL API (I might expand to other rendering APIs at some point, such as Vulkan). It will be useful for me to have this around for various projects I might want to do in the future.
### Long-term Goals
Once I finish building the basic API I will be able to use this library in other projects, where I plan to learn more about computer graphics and rendering techniques. As I build my portfolio, I expect that I will be able to adapt some of those projects to be features that I add to `efgl`. After a while of doing this, I hope to have a robust rendering "suite" for adding fancy graphics wherever I want.
## Getting Started
### Requirements
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), although I plan to make this cross-platform eventually    
### Installation
Open a command prompt in the directory where you cloned this repo. Type the command `cd setup/`, followed by `./setup.exe`. In the `efgl/` directory, there should now be a file named `efgl.sln`.   
### Building `efgl` as a static library
First, open `efgl/efgl.sln` in Visual Studio. Click on the `efgl` __project__ (not solution) in the solution explorer on the left.

Press <kbd>âŒ˜B</kbd> to build the selected project. Now, in the main `eflg/` directory, your .lib file should be in a directory named something like `eflg/Debug-windows-x86_64/`.  
### Using the `efgl` Sandbox
First, open `efgl/efgl.sln` in Visual Studio. Then, you can simply use the Sandbox project as you would any other project as it comes with the linking and include directories already set up. Add your source files in `/efgl/efgl/Sandbox/src`, which will come with a simple `main.cpp` already there.
